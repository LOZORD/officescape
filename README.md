# `O F F I C E S C A P E ™`
An  ~ A E S T H E T I C ~ VR game in Unity 3D 

## Overview & Gameplay
OfficeScape (can be written as `O F F I C E S C A P E ™`) is a survival game produced through [Unity3D](https://unity3d.com/) and targeted at the [Oculus Rift](http://oculus.com).

The player starts at the top floor of a large, (mostly) empty office building (of indeterminate height), and must descend and survive for as many levels (literal and game-wise) as possible. The goal of the game is to survive the most amount of levels.

Throughout the skyscraper, they are chased by a [giant, moving marble statue](https://youtu.be/_4gl-FX2RvI?t=3m6s), who on contact, "retires" the player, starting the game over from the beginning. You can think of it as [Slender](http://slendergame.com/), but with [A E S T H E T I C S](https://www.reddit.com/r/VaporwaveAesthetics).

Mechanics I want to include are:
* procedural level generation
* use of 3D sound and music
* shortcuts and elevators
* collecting things (like staplers) to unlock certain abilities
* stamina (and other "skill-oriented" features)

This is my first time using Unity3D, as well as working with the Oculus Rift.
